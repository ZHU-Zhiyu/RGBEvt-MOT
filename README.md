RGB-Event MOT: A Cross-Modal Benchmark for Multi-Object Detection and Tracking.

Leveraging the power of contemporary deep learning techniques, it has become increasingly convenient for methodologies to recognize, detect, and track objects in real-world scenarios. Nonetheless, challenges persist, particularly regarding the robustness of these models in recognizing small objects, operating in low-illumination conditions, or dealing with occlusions. Recognizing the unique advantages offered by event-based vision - including superior temporal resolution, vast dynamic range, and minimal latency - it is quickly becoming a coveted tool among computer vision researchers. To bolster foundational research in areas such as object detection and tracking, we present this comprehensive cross-modal RGB-Event benchmark.
